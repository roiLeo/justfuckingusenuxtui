# Just fucking use Nuxt UI

You're building a Nuxt app and spending your precious fucking time reinventing the wheel with custom components? Stop. Just stop right there.

## "But I need full control over my components!"

No you fucking don't. You need to ship your product. Nuxt UI gives you beautifully designed, accessible components that work out of the fucking box. You know what's better than your custom-built, half-assed button component? A professionally designed one that someone actually tested.

## "I'm worried about bundle size"

It's tree-shakeable, genius. Built on top of Headless UI and Tailwind CSS. Only imports what you actually use. Meanwhile, you're over there importing the entire fucking universe just to make a modal work.

## "But customization—"

It's FULLY customizable with Tailwind CSS. You can theme the entire thing with a config file. Want dark mode? It's built in. Want your own color scheme? Change a few variables. Want to waste three weeks building your own component library instead? Be my fucking guest.

## What you get

- 30+ components that actually fucking work
- Accessibility baked in (you weren't going to add that anyway)
- Dark mode support (because it's 2026, not 2010)
- TypeScript support (for you type-safe nerds)
- Icons from any icon library you want
- Form validation that doesn't make you cry
- Modals, dropdowns, tooltips—all the shit you need

## "I prefer headless components so I can—"

Nuxt UI IS BUILT ON HEADLESS UI. It's literally a styled wrapper around battle-tested headless components. You get the flexibility of headless with the convenience of pre-styled components. It's the best of both worlds, you absolute muppet.

## Just install the damn thing

```bash
npx nuxi@latest module add ui
```

That's it. One fucking command. Now you have access to buttons, inputs, cards, tables, notifications, and everything else you need to build a modern web app.

## Stop overthinking it

Your users don't give a shit if you hand-crafted every component from scratch. They care if your app works and looks good. Nuxt UI helps you deliver both without wasting months of development time.

Built by the same people who made Nuxt. Actively maintained. Well documented. Used by thousands of developers who aren't wasting their time like you are.

## In conclusion

Just fucking use Nuxt UI. Your deadline is approaching. Your product manager is breathing down your neck. Your custom component library is a mess. Stop being precious about it and use tools that actually help you ship.
